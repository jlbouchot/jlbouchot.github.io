						<ul>
							<li><strong> Modern regression techniques <br/></strong>
							The class alternatively once (Thursday) or twice (Thursday + Friday) a week, online, 15:10--16:40.<br/>
							The language of teaching is English <br/>
							It is recommended that students get used to using <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> as some materials will be illustrated by this mean. In fact any other data processing, however trivial, will work fine (Excel is basic enoughg to be usable by anyone) <br/>
							Here is a tentative schedule and topics: <a href="teaching/bit/reg21/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> <br/>
							A communication channel will be open for everyone to contribute. It is expected that the students first try to solve problems among themselves (via WeChat or any collaboration tools they may enjoy: Teams / Slack / Discrod / etc ...) before asking for help.</br>
							It is expected some familiarities of the following topics 
							<ul>
								<li> Linear algebra (we will only review the bare minimum) </li>
								<li> Basic probability theory </li> 
								<li> Basic (Python) programming -- This will not be reviewed. However, the extent to which we will use Python will be very basic and will, in any case, not be used for any graded things. It will only be used as an addition to the course materials. It is the responsibility of the student to make sure they know how to set up their environment and I will not provide any support for this. </li>
							</ul></li>
							
							<li><strong> Modern optimization <br/></strong>
							The class meets twice a week, online, Thursday and Fridays, 13:20--14:55.<br/>
							The language of teaching is English <br/>
							It is recommended that students get used to using <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> as some materials and assignments will be given by this mean. <br/>
							Here is a tentative schedule and topics: <a href="teaching/bit/optim21/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> <br/>
							A communication channel will be open for everyone to contribute. It is expected from the students that they work together before asking the instructor for help. It is encouraged for them to set up collaboration tools such as a discord / slack channel.</br>
							It is expected some familiarities of the following topics 
							<ul>
								<li> Linear algebra (we will only review the bare minimum) </li>
								<li> Basic variational calculus </li> 
								<li> Basic (Python) programming -- This will not be reviewed. However, the extent to which we will use Python will be very basic and will, in any case, not be used for any graded things. It will only be used as an addition to the course materials. It is the responsibility of the student to make sure they know how to set up their environment and I will not provide any support for this. </li>

							<li>Here is a tentative schedule and topics: <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a></li>
							<li>Office hours are Sundays, 12:30pm-2:00pm; Central teaching building, Room 246 </li>
							<li>You can find the first <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/MtxA_Ex1.pdf">exercise sheet</a>. This will not be collected nor marked. 
							You can also look at some solutions or hints <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/Hint1_1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/Hint1_2.jpg">here</a> and <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/Hint1_3.jpg">here</a></li>
							<li>You can find the second <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/MtxA_Ex2.pdf">exercise sheet</a>. This will not be collected nor marked. 
							You can also look at some solutions or hints <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/Hint2_1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/Hint2_2.jpg">here</a> (homework 6 is not accurate, due to a typo in the original exercise sheet) and <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/Hint2_3.jpg">here</a>, and <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/Hint2_4.jpg">here</a></li>
							<li>Slides for the <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/slides_vectorSpaces.pdf">first lectures (basic linear algebra)</a>. This does not contain any proofs or results. Be aware that some of the <em>examples</em> are actually counter examples. 
							They have been treated in class. Here are some slides for <a href="teaching/bit/mtxa/slides_banach.pdf">Banach and Hilbert spaces</a>
